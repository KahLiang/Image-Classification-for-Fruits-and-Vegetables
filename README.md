# Image Classification for Fruits and Vegetables

In this experiment, a total of 6000 images are used to train and evaluate the model accuracy. The dataset was split into 70% (4200 pics) for training data and 30% (1800 pics) for testing data. The dataset was manually resized to 84*84 pixels before the experiment. The features used to train and evaluate are the shapes and the colors from the images.

# Datasets
The dataset contains 6000 images and 600 images for each category. Total of **TEN** categories for the fruits and vegetables. There are Cabbage, Carrot, Chili, Cucumber, Ginger, Long Bean, Potato, Sprouts and Tomato.

# Experiment Methods
- Logistic Regression
- Convolutional Neural Network

In the end, the **Logistic Regression achieved 83% accuracy** and the **Convolutional Neural Networks achieved 95% accuracy** for the classification model.
